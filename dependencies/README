3D3A-MATLAB-Toolbox Dependencies
=================================

Some functions in the 3D3A MATLAB Toolbox require additional toolboxes, APIs and software to work. If these toolboxes are not already added to the MATLAB search path, perform any one of the following tasks:

1. Connect to the internet and call the function "start3D3AMATLABToolbox.m" from MATLAB's Command Window. If the function does not find the required toolboxes in the MATLAB search path, the default MATLAB folder (type "userpath" in MATLAB's Command Window to get the full path to this folder), or here in the "dependencies" folder, an attempt will be made to download them from the web and store them here in the "dependencies" folder.

2. If the toolboxes have already been downloaded manually, either place them here in the "dependencies" folder or anywhere in the default MATLAB folder. Alternatively, if stored elsewhere, manually add the location to the MATLAB search path.
Finally, call the function "start3D3AMATLABToolbox.m" from MATLAB's Command Window.
