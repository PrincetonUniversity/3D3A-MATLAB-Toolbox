# 3D3A-MATLAB-Toolbox Dependencies

Some functions in the 3D3A MATLAB Toolbox require additional toolboxes, APIs and software to work. If these toolboxes (see list below) are not already added to the MATLAB search path, perform **any one** of the following tasks:

1. If the toolboxes have already been downloaded manually, either place them here in the "dependencies" folder or anywhere in the default MATLAB folder (type "userpath" in MATLAB's Command Window to get the full path to this folder on your device). Alternatively, if stored elsewhere, manually add the location to the MATLAB search path. Finally, in MATLAB, navigate to the 3D3A MATLAB Toolbox folder and call the function "start3D3AMATLABToolbox.m" from MATLAB's Command Window.

2. Connect to the internet, navigate to the 3D3A MATLAB Toolbox folder from within MATLAB and call the function "start3D3AMATLABToolbox.m" from MATLAB's Command Window. If the function does not find the required toolboxes in the MATLAB search path, the default MATLAB folder, or here in the "dependencies" folder, an attempt will be made to download them from the web and store them here in the "dependencies" folder.
