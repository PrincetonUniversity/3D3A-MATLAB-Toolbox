To maintain consistency in the MATLAB help throughout the toolbox, refer to the following checklist:
	Is the function name bold?
	Are the syntax options defined?
	Are optional inputs listed correctly? 
	Are the relevant ‘see also’ functions listed?
	Are any relevant references listed?

See the composite example below.

%RCEPS Real cepstrum.
%   RCEPS(X) returns the real cepstrum of the real sequence X.
%
%   [XHAT, YHAT] = RCEPS(X) returns both the real cepstrum XHAT and
%   YHAT which is a unique minimum-phase sequence that has the same real
%   cepstrum as X.
%
%   AUDIOWRITE(FILENAME,Y,FS,Name1,Value1,Name2,Value2, ...) 
%   Specifies optional comma-separated pairs of Name,Value arguments, 
%   where Name is the argument name and Value is the corresponding value. 
%   Name must appear inside single quotes (' '). You can specify several 
%   name and value pair arguments in any order as Name1,Value1,...,NameN,
%   ValueN.  Valid Name,Value arguments are as follows:
%
%   'BitsPerSample'  Number of bits per sample to write out to the audio 
%                    file.  
%                    Only supported for WAVE (.wav) and FLAC(.flac) files.
%                    Valid values are 8,16,24,32, or 64 and vary depending 
%                    upon the supported format. 
%                    See "Output Data Type" section below for more details.
%
%   'BitRate'        Number of kilobits per second (kbps) used for compressed 
%                    audio files.  In general, the larger the BitRate The 
%                    higher the compressed audio quality.
%                    Only Supported for MPEG-4 Audio (.m4a, .mp4) files.
%
%   'Title'          String representing a title to be written to the file.
%
%   'Artist'         String representing the artist or author to be written
%                    to the file.
%
%   'Comment'        String representing a comment to be written to the 
%                    file.
%
%   EXAMPLE: Show that YHAT is a unique minimum-phase sequence that has the
%            % same real cepstrum as X.
%            y = [4 1 5]; % Non-minimum phase sequence
%            [xhat,yhat] = rceps(y);
%            xhat2= rceps(yhat);
%            [xhat' xhat2']
