function t = getTimeVec(Fs,N)
%GETTIMEVEC Vector of linearly-spaced time values.
%   T = GETTIMEVEC(FS,N) returns a length N column-vector of linearly-
%   spaced time values ranging from 0 to (N - 1)/FS. If FS is specified in
%   Hz (samples per second), then T is returned in seconds; if specified in
%   kHz, then T is returned in milliseconds.
